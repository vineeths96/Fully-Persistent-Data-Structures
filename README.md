<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project implements a small library of persistent data structures in C. This library supports both partially and fully persistent versions of the data structures. The library includes the following data structures and all the usual operations on them.

1. Heterogeneous vector (supports elements of different types)
2. Map
3. Stack
4. Queue 
5. Double-ended queue
6. Singly linked linked list
7. Doubly linked linked list

The library has separate directories for partial and full persistence. Within each directory, there are sub-directories --- each corresponding to a particular data structure. The program for each data structure is written in three files - `client.c`, `header.c`, and `implement.c`. Comments have been added frequently to help in understanding the logic behind implementation. The  `client.c` files contains some basic testing of the the persistence for the data structures. Refer [Problem statement](./Problem%20Statement.pdf) file for detailed information.



### Built With

* Ubuntu 18.04.1 
* gcc version 7.4.0



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into a local machine using

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vineeths96/Persistent-Data-Structures
```

### Instructions to run

##### Fully Persistent Data Structures

Open the terminal, and `cd` to the directory of the data structure within `Fully Persistent Data Structures`.  

```
cd Fully Persistent Data Structures/<DataStructure>
```

Make the program and run it.

```shell
make
./a.out
```

##### Partially Persistent Data Structures

Open the terminal, and `cd` to the directory of the data structure within `Partially Persistent Data Structures`.  

```
cd Partially Persistent Data Structures/<DataStructure>
```

Make the program and run it.

```shell
make
./a.out
```
